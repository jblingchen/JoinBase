## JoinBase Community

Welcome to JoinBase Community.

## :newspaper: Change Log :newspaper:

Watch the [change log](/CHANGELOG.md) for the latest updating to the products and communities.

## :bento: Get the Community Edition :bento:

JoinBase's community edition now is a freeware: any people and company can use it free both for non-commercial and commercial purposes (including cloud services). 

The community edition has the same functions as the enterprise edition, although the services are different. We support the community edition in the community as best as possible. Feel free to request and send out any question here.

Currently, we hope interested users can reach us by requesting the distribution explicitly via [the request page](https://joinbase.io/request) or via [email](mailto://contact@joinbase.io). This greatly helps the early-phase growth of the product. We take this to build a sustainable business path to better serve all people and enterprises in this era. 

When appropriate, we will provide the free release download of the community edition in the community.
